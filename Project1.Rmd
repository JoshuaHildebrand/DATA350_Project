# Draft Set of Questions

# 1. How does AlcoholDay compare between Married and Divorced marital status groups across Race3

- To analyze the relationship between marital status and alcohol consumption, we filtered the dataset to include only participants aged 20 and older from the 2011–2012 survey cycle. We then mutated the MaritalStatus variable to create MaritalStatus2. This new variable grouped the marriage statuses “NeverMarried”, “LivePartner” and “Divorced” into “Not Married”. Although the marriage status “Widowed” could technically be included in the “Not Married” variable,  it was excluded due to its distinct demographic characteristics which could confound the analysis. Because widowed individuals tend to differ substantially in age, life stage, and social context from those who are single, divorced, or cohabiting, including them in the “Not Married” category could obscure meaningful differences in drinking behavior by introducing potential exogenous variables (i.e. loneliness, grief). However, further analysis could be conducted to assess how including the “Widowed” category might affect the KDE distributions and whether its inclusion yields meaningful differences across racial groups. The “Married” category of MaritalStatus2 included only the “Married” variable. As a result, the “Married” and “Not Married” categories of MaritalStatus2 consisted of 1,894 and 1,656 participants, respectively. The reason for using Race3 as the race variable instead of Race1 was because it included an “Asian” category.

- To visualize the distributions of days per year drinking between the two marital status groups by race, we used six kernel density plots (one for each race category). By examining separate kernel density plots, we could identify differences in distributional patterns, such as skewness, variability, or the presence of multiple modes. We log-transformed the AlcoholYear variable to correct for right skewness and improve the interpretability of the density plots. When creating the KDE plots, we log-transformed the AlcoholYear data because it was a non-normal distribution that was skewed to the right. This transformation reduces skewness, allowing for a more symmetric distribution and improving the interpretability and comparability of the density estimates across groups. The distributions for "Asian", "Mexican", and "Other" participants exhibited bimodal patterns, whereas those for the "Black", "White", and "Hispanic" groups largely overlapped.

- Because log-transformed KDE plots do not convey specific numerical values such as means or medians, we also created a bar plot with error bars to better visualize the central tendencies and variability of drinking frequency by marital status across race groups. We calculated the mean, median, and 95% confidence intervals of the data, grouped by race and marital status. Because most participants reported drinking on the lower end of the 365-day range, the means were disproportionately influenced by a small number of heavy drinkers. As a result, there was a substantial gap between the mean and median values. This pattern is clearly visible in the graph, where median drinking days for each racial group do not exceed 24 days per year, while mean values reach as high as ~87 days per year due to the mean’s sensitivity to outliers. Interestingly, the median number of drinking days for "White" participants was 24 in both marital status groups, while for "Hispanic" participants it was 12 in both. For all other racial groups, the median reported drinking days were noticeably higher for the Not Married category. “Other” had the lowest median drinking days for the Married category at only 3 drinks. Mean drinking days for the “Asian”, “Black”, “Hispanic”, and “Other” racial groups were higher for the Not Married category, while being the same for each status at ~45 drinks for the Mexican category. Interestingly, the “White” category was the only racial group that had higher average drinking days for “Married” compared to Not Married. These results show the sensitivity of mean and median to outliers and underscore the importance of log-transforming the data to visualize distribution in the KDE plots.

- We also visualized the distribution of marital status across racial groups using faceted pie charts. Each chart represents one race category from the NHANES dataset, with slices corresponding to "Married" and "Not Married" participants. The size of each slice reflects the relative proportion of individuals within that race who fall into each marital status group. This visualization helps compare how marriage rates differ across races – for example, showing that “White” participants have the highest proportion of married individuals, while “Black” participants have the lowest. 

# 2. What is the distribution of testosterone in the data set over age and how does it vary across BMI groups?

## Testosterone by Age Across BMI WHO Groups for Males

-   Testosterone variable is total testosterone in nanograms per deciliter for participants aged 6 years or older for the years 2011-2012.
-   Age is the age of the participant in 2011-2012, subjects who were 80 years or older were recorded as 80
-   BMI WHO is the body mass index as categorized by the World Health Organization as 12.0-18.4 (underweight), 18.5-24.9 (normal weight), 25-29.9 (overweight), and 30 plus (Obese).

```{r}
NHANES_t <- NHANESraw |>
  select('Testosterone', 'Age', 'Gender','BMI_WHO') |>
  mutate(BMI_WHO = case_when(
    BMI_WHO == '12.0_18.5' ~ 'Underweight',
    BMI_WHO == '18.5_to_24.9' ~ 'Normal Weight',
    BMI_WHO == '25.0_to_29.9' ~ 'Overweight',
    BMI_WHO == '30.0_plus' ~ 'Obese'
  ))

NHANES_t |>
  filter(Gender == 'male') |>
  drop_na(BMI_WHO)|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Testosterone)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = BMI_WHO), size = 0.65)+
  facet_wrap(~BMI_WHO) +
  labs(title = 'Testosterone vs Age', y = 'Testosterone (ng/dL)',
       col = 'BMI WHO', caption = 'Source: NHANESraw dataset') + 
  theme_bw()
```

-   Since the distributions are not normal, robust statistics are appropriate for better understanding the distributions.
  - Median and interquartile range are used to accurately compare the spread of testosterone data by age group overtime.

## Median Testosterone by Age Across BMI WHO groups.

       caption = 'Source: NHANESraw Dataset, Error Bar: First Quartile, Median, Third Quartile') +

```
- Age is grouped into approximately twenty year increments starting at the first age recorded for testosterone which is six years

  )
```

- To analyze the relationship between poverty and health outcomes, we filtered the data to include only adults (age 18+) with complete data on race, poverty ratio, BMI and cholesterol. BMI and cholesterol are key indicators of overall health that can reflect how socioeconomic factors can influence physical health across populations. Since there were two continuous variables, a scatter plot with a smoothing line, faceted by race, was used to visualize the relationship to show whether BMI trends differ across racial groups and whether poverty predicts BMI. From the plot, most participants cluster around a poverty ratio between 0–2 and BMI values between 20–40. The trend lines are relatively flat, suggesting no strong overall correlation between income and BMI. Most groups stayed relatively consistent around a BMI of 30, while the Mexican group stayed consistent around a BMI of 25. The Other category shows more fluctuation and higher degree of uncertainty according to the confidence interval. For the cholesterol plot, a jitter plot overlapping with a boxplot was used because the variables are continuous, and this was able to show both the distribution of values, the spread, and median for each group. The White and Black groups have the largest sample sizes, which explains their denser clusters. Median cholesterol values are fairly similar across races, clustering around 5 mmol/L, though the Other group’s median appears slightly lower. Hispanic participants show the widest spread (largest IQR), suggesting more variation in cholesterol levels, while Mexican and Asian groups have smaller spreads. Overall, cholesterol levels are relatively consistent across racial groups. Together, these plots suggest that while BMI and cholesterol levels don’t differ drastically across income or race, small differences in variability may point to underlying social or health factors. Further analysis could investigate whether gender, age, or lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking explain these subtle patterns.

```

- To analyze the relationship between the age participants first used cigarettes or used marijuana and education, selected variables included education, gender, SmokeAge, and AgeRegMarij, removing any missing values. Age variables were grouped into categories (<15, 15–17, 18–20, 21+) to help simplify the visualization and highlight trends across age ranges. Bar charts were chosen because they effectively display the distribution of a subgroup across categories. In this case, two discrete variables are grouped by a third discrete variable, and dodge-positioned bars allow for direct comparison of age groups within each education level. The plots were faceted by gender to explore potential differences between males and females. Across both cigarettes and marijuana, most participants started between ages 15–17, with high frequencies for individuals with a high school education or some college. College graduates also report starting in this age range, but in smaller numbers. Male participants generally have higher frequencies, particularly in the high school category, while females show the highest counts for some college education. For cigarette and marijuana use, the 8th grade education level has <15 age group as the highest bar. Very early smoking age (<15) is more common for cigarette use than marijuana where the <15 age group is the second-highest age group in some college, high school, and 9th–11th grade groups. For marijuana, the <15 age group is lower across all education levels, indicating that fewer participants start marijuana use very early compared to cigarettes. Overall, the age participants first used cigarettes or used marijuana began in mid-teens (15–17). Among these, males typically finished high school, while females most often reached some college. Future analysis could focus on how these patterns relate to health outcomes later in life. It could also explore whether starting age correlates with race or socioeconomic status.
